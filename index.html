          <h2>So How Does This Apply To Me?</h2>
          <p>A lot of developers don't realize the impact they have on
          application security as they write code day to day. By
          ensuring that you as a developer are doing your due
          diligence to not introduce security vulnerabilities into an
          application we can make
          the world a safer place for all of us :)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>But My Framework Takes Care of Security Right?</h2>
          <p>Many modern frameworks do have features to help mitigate
          security threats... But you have to know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What they are</li>
            <li>How and when to use them</li>
            <li>Where they fall short</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>But If An Attacker Wants To Get In They Will!</h2>
          <p>It doesn't mean we have to make things easy for attackers!</p>
          <p>Many vulnerabilities are preventable by simply being
          aware of them and taking simple precautions</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>It's Our Responsibility</h2>
          <p>Security should always be considered as software is being
          developed. It is our responsibility as developers
          to help protect our organization from information disclosure
          and most importantly, to help protect the users of
          our system who trust us to protect them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Due Diligence and Compliance</h2>
          <p>Our clients demand and trust that we are on top of our
          security game. To earn our clients trust in our
          commitment to application security we must train. This is
          the start of that training.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A1 Injection</h2>
          <p>Injection refers to injecting malicious code into a
          context where it can be executed. Some examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SQL Injection</li>
            <li>NO-SQL Injection</li>
            <li>Buffer Overflow</li>
            <li>Command Injection</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Example: SQL Injection</h2>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
            SELECT * FROM Users
            WHERE Username='$username'
            AND Password='$password'
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What's The Problem?</h2>
          <p>Un-sanitized user input is being sent to an interpreter
          which can cause it to execute unitended commands</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Malicious Example</h2>
          <p>Given the malicious inputs of:</p>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          $username = 1' or '1' = '1
          $password = 1' or '1' = '1
					</code></pre>
          <p>The resulting query would be:</p>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          SELECT * FROM Users
          WHERE Username='1' OR '1' = '1'
          AND Password='1' OR '1' = '1'
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What Would This Do?</h2>
          <p>This would essentially choose the first user in the <em>Users</em> table
          because 1 always equals 1.</p>
          <p>Injecting something like this in a login form could
          essentially bypass an authentication system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How To Stop Injection</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Utilize query parameterization</li>
            <li>Enforce input field type and size</li>
            <li>Ensure option selects and radios submit expected values</li>
            <li>White listing versus black listing allowed input</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Parameterized Query Examples:</h2>
          <h3>ASP.NET</h3>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          string sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers
                        WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId";
          SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql);
          command.Parameters.Add(
            new SqlParameter("@CustomerId", System.Data.SqlDbType.Int));
          command.Parameters["@CustomerId"].Value = 1;
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Parameterized Query Examples Continued:</h2>
          <h3>Ruby ActiveRecord</h3>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          # Create
          Project.create!(:name => 'owasp')
          # Read
          Project.all(:conditions => "name = ?", name)
          Project.all(:conditions => { :name => name })
          Project.where("name = :name", :name => name)
          # Update
          project.update_attributes(:name => 'owasp')
          # Delete
          Project.delete(:name => 'name')
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Notes About Injection:</h2>
          <p>In the interest of time only SQL Injection has been
          highlighted. There are many forms of injection but they boil
          down to allowing unsanitized user input to reach an
          interpreter. For more information
          on other types of injection reference the OWASP site, the
          OWASP Cheatsheet, or Google</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A2 Weak Authentication and Session Management</h2>
          <p>The name does a pretty good job of describing it but what
          would be some examples?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A2 Examples:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Not setting "HTTPOnly" and "Secure" attributes on a
            session cookie</li>
            <li>Failing to verify a user is authenticated in secure areas</li>
            <li>Failing to verify user has proper privilege level to
            perform an operation</li>
            <li>Not leveraging CSRF Tokens on all forms</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A2 Prevention:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Set "HTTPOnly" and "Secure" attributes on a session cookie</li>
            <li>Verify a user is authenticated in secure areas</li>
            <li>Verify user has proper privilege level to perform an
            operation</li>
            <li>Leveraging CSRF Tokens on all forms</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A3 XSS</h2>
          <p>XSS occurs when attackers inject client-side scripts into
          web pages viewed by other users. There are 3 types of XSS attacks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stored XSS</li>
            <li>Reflected XSS</li>
            <li>DOM Based XSS</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Stored XSS</h2>
          <p>Stored XSS occurs when client-side scripts are persisted
          to a data store and then execute when the data is retrieved
          to be presented on a page.</p>
          <p>Failure to sanitize input coming into the system before
          persistence and failure to escape data being rendered on the
          page before presentation allow
          for this sort of attack to occur.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Reflected XSS</h2>
          <p>Reflected XSS is similar to stored XSS except that the
          malicious client-side code isn't stored to the
          database. Instead, the code is often submitted as part of
          the initial request to the server and the server accepts and
          returns it as part of the response that builds the page.
          </p>
          <p>Again failure to sanitize input coming into the system
          and failure to escape data being rendered on the page before
          presentation allow
          for this sort of attack to occur.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>DOM Based XSS</h2>
          <p>DOM Based XSS is similar to reflected. The difference is
          that the submitted malicious payload doesn't end up as part
          of the rendered page but rather manipulates the way client
          side code contained in the page already executes.</p>
          <p>Again failure to sanitize input coming into the system
          and failure to escape data being rendered on the page before
          presentation allow
          for this sort of attack to occur.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>DOM Based XSS Example</h2>
          <h3>Vulnerable Code</h3>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          Select your language:

          <select><sc\ript>

          document.write("<OPTION value=1>"+
          document.location.href.substring(
          document.location.href.indexOf("p=")+8)+
          "</OPTION>");

          document.write("<OPTION value=2>English</OPTION>");

          </scr\ipt></select>
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Malicious Payload</h3>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          http://foo.io/bar.html?p=<scri\pt>alert(document.cookie)</scri\pt>
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A3 XSS Prevention</h3>
          <p>XSS is prevented by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sanitizing all user input. This should be done client
            side as well as server side. Constrain all input to
            expected types and lengths.</li>
            <li>Output encode all user submitted data per output context.</li>
            <li>Avoid dynamically building javascript based upon user
            supplied data.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A4 Insecure Direct Object Reference</h3>
          <p>Insecure direct object reference occurs when a parameter
          is used directly to retrieve a resource, perform an
          operation, or access functionality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A4 Insecure Direct Object Reference Example</h3>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
          http://foo.bar/user/10/edit
					</code></pre>
          <p>If the 10 in the above example is manipulated and a
          different user can be edited successfully, we have direct
          object reference</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A4 Insecure Direct Object Reference Prevention</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Leverage UUID's instead of integers</li>
            <li>Validate a user allowed to (CRUD) the resource in question</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A5 Security Misconfiguration</h3>
          <p>Security misconfiguration deals with any sort of configuration that could
          be misconfigured that would make an application
          insecure. Some examples might include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Servers that have not been hardened</li>
            <li>PHP configured to allow local or remote file includes</li>
            <li>Allowing direct root login via password</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A5 Security Misconfiguration Prevention</h3>
          <p>Insure configuration options are fully understood. Research best practices
          on hardening and configuring a system / application
          environment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A6 Sensitive Data Exposure</h3>
          <p>Sensitive data exposure deals with weak encryption. If
            data is encrypted with a weak cipher than the data can
            easily be decrypted and thus exposed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A6 Sensitive Data Exposure Prevention</h3>
          <p>Preventing sensitive data exposure
          can be achieved with strong encryption. At the time of this
          writing recommendations would include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AES 128 bit or better ciphers</li>
            <li>SHA 256 bit or better hashing with salts for passwords</li>
            <li>Use TLS 1.2 or later for web communications</li>
            <li>Buy extended validation (EV) certificates for web servers</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A7 Missing Function Level Access Control</h3>
          <p>This revolves around getting access to a resource a user should not be
          able to see. This could be access to an area of a site they shouldn't have
          access to or possible viewing files on a server they
          shouldn't have access to.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A7 Missing Function Level Access Control Prevention</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't rely on security through obscurity</li>
            <li>Each request should be verified at the time of access</li>
            <li>Verify all functionality with a low privilege account and ensure the
            user cannot access things they shouldn't</li>
            <li>Practice the deny-by-default rule</li>
            <li>Principal of least privilege</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A8 Cross Site Request Forgery</h3>
          <p>CSRF occurs when an application can accept forged requests from another site other than itself.</p>
          <p>Lets say Chase was vulnerable to this and I know you bank at Chase and may have never logged out the last time you visited. I lure you click on a link that looks like the following:</p>

					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>

          <a href="http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA&amount=100000">
            View my Pictures!</a>

					</code></pre>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A8 Cross Site Request Forgery Example Continued</h3>
          <p>If you were logged into Chase and clicked on the link you may have just transfered $100,000.00 to Maria!</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A8 Cross Site Request Forgery Prevention</h3>
          <p>CSRF can be prevented by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using CSRF tokens</li>
            <li>Log out of applications when finished</li>
            <li>Be judicious in your use of CORS</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A9 Using Components With Known Vulnerabilities</h3>
          <p>Nuff said. Make sure to keep up to date on patches and updates. This
          is exactly how common CMS platforms are hacked. People setup
          the sites but never update their plugins /
          modules. Vulnerabilities are found and than an attacker
          exploits the un-patched system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</h3>
          <p>This is leveraged redirect an unsuspecting user to a
          malicious system. Lets say an application has a page that
          redirects users to a page based upon a param. Lets say the
          application also allows users to post links and a link like
          the following is posted:</p>

					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
            http://www.example.com/redirect.jsp?url=evil.com
					</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Continued</h3>
          <p>This jsp page that performs redirects can be hi-jacked to get people to redirect to a malicious application that the attacker owns.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Prevention</h3>
          <p>Design the application to not leverage URL redirect params.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>So Thats All I Need To Know To Write Secure Software?</h3>
          <p>No! This is just the tip of the iceberg. It is however a good foundation
          to build off of. By being aware of these common vulnerabilities we can help
          reduce the risk of introducing an easily avoidable vulnerability into our
          software.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
